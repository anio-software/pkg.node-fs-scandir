	 * @brief Asynchronously scan a directory.
	 * @description
	 * Asynchronously scans the directory located at `path`.
	 * Returns all entries as an array if `callback` was not specified.
	 * If `callback` was specified, this function will always return `null`.
	 * @param path The directory to be scanned.
	 * @param options The options parameter can contain the following properties:
	 * 
	 * "callback"
	 * If this property is set, instead of returning an array of entries
	 * scandir will call this callback instead. Callback may be asynchronous.
	 * 
	 * "filter"
	 * If this property is set, instructs scandir to filter entries based
	 * on the return value of the function provided. Callback may be asynchronous.
	 * 
	 * "map"
	 * If this property is set, maps the entries with the provided function. Callback may be asynchronous.
	 * 
	 * "reverse"
	 * Sets the order in which scandir reports entries.
	 * `true` means report directories before reporting files.
	 * 
	 * "sorted"
	 * If set, sorts entries with `localCompare`.
	 * This option has no effect if `callback` was specified.
	 * 
	 * "allow_missing_dir"
	 * Allow entry directory path to not exist. Paths that are
	 * broken symlinks or non directories (like files) don't count.
	 * 
	 * @return
	 * Array of entries or `null` if `callback` option was provided.
